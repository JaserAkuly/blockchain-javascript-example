Blockchain with JavaScript. 

It's not a complete implementation, but enough to understand how blockchains work and how they guarantee that blocks can never be changed. After creating our blockchain I tried and tamper with it. This will demonstrate a blockchains ability to detect fraud. Adding the proof-of-work mechanism to our blockchain. Proof-of-work will secure our blockchain against spammers and people trying to tamper with our blocks.

#ToDo
-Would eventually like to build a front end. (Potentially a learning guide to how BlockChain Works.)
